Description: Rectangle packing is a packing problem where rectangles are placed
    into a larger rectangular region (without overlapping) in order to maximise
    the use space.  Rectangles are packed using the skyline heuristic as discussed 
    in Lijun et al (2011) 'A Skyline-Based Heuristic for the 2D Rectangular Strip
    Packing Problem' <doi:10.1007/978-3-642-21827-9_29>.  A function is also 
    included for determining a good small-sized box for containing a given
    set of rectangles.
